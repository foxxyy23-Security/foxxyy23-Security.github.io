Bryan Fox
Cybersecurity Analyst II | Security Engineering & Automation | Mentoring the Next Gen of Defenders

## BIO
I believe cybersecurity is a people problem as much as a technical one.

Over the last 4 years, I’ve moved from configuring firewalls to automating incident response, but my core mission remains the same: **Empower the defense.**

Currently, as a **Cybersecurity Analyst II at EMPIST**, I operate as a technical escalation point and a builder. I don’t just handle the toughest incidents; I build the integrations that make our team faster and write the SOPs that make our process repeatable.

But the code isn't the best part—the team is. I am deeply passionate about **mentorship and leadership**. Helping a Level 1 analyst connect the dots on an alert or guiding a peer through a complex investigation is where I find the most impact.

**My Focus:**
🚀 **Engineering:** Automating workflows to reduce alert fatigue.
🤝 **Leadership:** Mentoring analysts and fostering a culture of curiosity.
🛡️ **Operations:** Validating security stacks (SentinelOne, Tenable, etc.) to ensure they actually work.

I am building a personal brand to share what I learn, not to be a 'guru,' but to help others climb the ladder with me.

Ex-Collegiate Athlete. Team player by default.
